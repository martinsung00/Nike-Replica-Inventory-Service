# Inventory Service

> This project re-creates and re-imagines parts of the Nike website by using a micro-serviced based architecture. Unlike websites that utilizes a monolithic architecture, this re-created Nike.com separates its services into four indepent parts. Each with their own database, server and react client. This individual service, the inventory service, is responsible for storing and displaying the current stock of a specific shoe. Clients are then able to see and select the available sizes on this service before they add an item to the shopping cart. The other services that work in conjunction with this service is the products service.
